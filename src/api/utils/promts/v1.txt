I am studying English and I need to divide the text into simpler phrases for learning and memorization.
    The text should not be divided into any additional blocks.
    Try to make short phrases, but try to avoid making the phrase consist of one word.
    Try not to make phrases longer than 20 words.
    Don't correct grammar if there are mistakes and do not delete or change words from the source text.
    Save various numbers, symbols, and other text data.
    The number of words (including different numbers, symbols) and the words themselves must be the same as in the original text.
